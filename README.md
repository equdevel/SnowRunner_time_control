## SnowRunner time control

Allows to control time in SnowRunner: start/stop, rewind/forward, speed up time (x1 - x10 faster than real time) and also synchronize time with a real clock.

Launch the application after SnowRunner and don't close it while the game is running.

Works on all versions of SnowRunner.

### Antivirus

If your antivirus complains, add the program to the exceptions (unfortunately, this is inevitable for all such programs, since they change the state of the game in RAM).
