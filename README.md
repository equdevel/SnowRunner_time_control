## SnowRunner time control

Allows to control time in SnowRunner: start/stop and inrease/reduce timer.

Launch the application after SnowRunner and don't close it while the game is running.

### Hotkeys:

NumPad / &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start game timer

NumPad * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop game timer

NumPad - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce timer by 2 hours

NumPad + &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inrease timer by 2 hours

### Antivirus

If your antivirus complains, add the program to the exceptions (unfortunately, this is inevitable for all such programs, since they change the state of the game in RAM).

If in doubt, see [the report at VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/64b26414a007c436af66c39cbdaa92699eb2f90999669efaa1124a2542efd4a6?nocache=1)
